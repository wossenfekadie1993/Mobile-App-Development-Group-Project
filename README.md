  1. Personalized Reminders: One feature that could make your medicine time reminder app stand out is personalized reminders. Rather than just reminding users to take their medication at the same time every day, the app could learn about each user's individual schedule and preferences. For example, some users may need to take their medication with food, while others may prefer to take it before bedtime. By allowing users to set personalized reminders that take their unique needs into account, your app could help ensure that they never miss a dose.
